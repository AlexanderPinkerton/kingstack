## Why Use Advanced Optimistic Store?

Modern apps need to feel instant, stay correct, and scale without turning your state layer into a ball of mud. **@kingstack/advanced-optimistic-store (AOS)** gives you that balance by combining MobX, TanStack Query Core, and optional realtime into a single, coherent pattern.

### ⚡ Instant, Confident UX

Give users the feeling that everything happens immediately—because from their perspective, it does.

* Optimistic updates apply instantly, before the server responds
* Automatic rollback keeps your UI honest when something fails
* No more “loading…” flicker for every small interaction

Your app feels like it’s running on local data, while still staying fully in sync with the backend.

---

### 🧠 Clear Separation of Concerns

Stop forcing one tool to do everything.

* **UI domain (MobX)** handles reactive lists, computed values, snapshots, and rollback
* **API domain (TanStack Query Core)** manages caching, fetches, mutations, and background syncing
* **Transformation layer** cleanly maps API data ↔ UI data with type safety

You get a state model that’s easy to reason about, test, and evolve—without hidden coupling between your UI and API logic.

---

### 🗃️ Perfect Fit for CRUD Backends

AOS really shines when paired with a straightforward backend design:

* A **DB table or collection** for each entity
* A clean **CRUD API** for that entity
* **Mutation endpoints that return the full updated object**

This makes optimistic updates trivial: the UI instantly shows the change, and the server’s response “locks in” the final, authoritative version without extra refetching or reconciliation hacks.

---

### 🧾 Forms That Map Directly to Operations

For maximum speed and clarity, each mutation is best paired with its own form:

* A form per operation (create, update, etc.)
* Fields match the **UI data shape** (or a subset of it)
* Minimal transformation between what the user fills out and what the API expects

That means fewer bugs, less glue code, and a more intuitive mental model:
**“This form drives this mutation, which updates this store.”**

---

### 🌐 Realtime-Ready When You Are

If your app needs realtime updates, AOS plugs into WebSockets or other event sources without rewriting your state layer:

* Realtime events merge into the same optimistic store
* Deterministic local mutation ordering and self-echo prevention are built in
* Local optimistic changes and remote updates stay in sync

You don’t have to choose between “optimistic” and “realtime” — you get both.

---

### 🧩 Framework-Agnostic, Future-Proof

AOS is designed to slot into your stack, not lock you into one.

* Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS
* UI stays powered by MobX observables
* API logic stays powered by TanStack Query Core
* Your data model stays consistent across the entire app

You can refactor your UI layer, evolve your API, or add realtime later—without rewriting how your state works.

---

### 💻 Developer Experience That Feels Right

* No more hand-rolling optimistic logic for every feature
* No more guessing how API data will flow into the UI
* No more bolting realtime onto an already fragile state layer

Instead, you get a **single, opinionated pattern**:

> A DB table → a CRUD API → an AOS store → forms and components bound to a fast, optimistic, reactive UI.

The end result: a system that feels instant to users, predictable to developers, and scalable for your product.
