CORE MANTRAS:
- An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity

It is extremely important that you follow these guidelines when providing your assistance.

FILE EXECUTION RULE: With the exception of creating new files. DO NOT attempt to run any commands yourself. Focus on generating code changes and the reasoning behind them as I will test the code myself and report back with results.

WRITING TESTS:
- Never mock 1st party business logic modules. Always let the product's creat code execute. Mocking things like network / db/ io is fine.

Please remove any old or unused code unless otherwise specified. Do not leave old crap laying around. Ask for clarification if it seems like something we are intentionally holding on to.
